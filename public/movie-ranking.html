<h3>Eagle Eye, Transcendence</h3>
<p>My favorite Sci-Fis. Tickles your imagination for the possibility of the plot.</p>
<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>Apart from it's literally 10 years in the making, who wouldn't forget the standoff between Thanos and The Avengers' armies.</p>
<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>I had Mixed Emotions after watching this.</p>
